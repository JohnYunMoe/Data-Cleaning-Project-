# Ethics Statement for Movie and Streaming Services Database Project

## CAUTION
This project was meant to be a demo and so some of the guidelines below were forgone for the testing process. Despite this, one should 
always try to adhere to the rules of both the document outlined below and of the website that they are scraping. 

## Introduction
In our project, we utilize web scraping techniques to collect data about movie streaming services. While web scraping can be an effective method for data collection, we recognize the importance of considering the ethical implications and legal boundaries associated with its use.

## Use of Web Scraping
We employ web scraping to extract streaming availability data from various online sources, particularly from websites like JustWatch. However, we understand that scraping certain websites may violate their terms of service.

### JustWatch and Other Websites
- **JustWatch.com**: We acknowledge that the terms of service for JustWatch explicitly prohibit automated access to their website without prior permission. Therefore, we are aware that scraping data from JustWatch is not permitted.
- **Responsibility**: It is our responsibility to ensure that any scraping we conduct respects the terms and conditions set forth by the websites we target.

## Ethical Considerations
1. **Compliance with Terms of Service**: Before we scrape any website, we will carefully read and understand its terms of service to ensure our compliance.
   
2. **Respect for Data Ownership**: We recognize that websites invest considerable resources into building and maintaining their content. Scraping their data without permission can undermine their business models, and we strive to avoid this.

3. **Rate Limiting**: If we decide to scrape data, we will do so responsibly, ensuring that we do not overwhelm the target website with requests, which could negatively impact their server performance.

4. **Data Privacy**: We will take care to avoid collecting personal data or any information that may violate privacy regulations.

5. **Attribution**: When we use data from scraped sources, we commit to providing appropriate attribution, clearly acknowledging the source of the data.

## Conclusion
We approach the use of web scraping in this project with caution and a strong commitment to ethical standards. We encourage seeking permission from website owners when necessary and exploring official APIs or data sources whenever possible.

By adhering to these ethical guidelines, we can foster a respectful and responsible approach to data collection.
